        <p class="paragraph"> Nazmani Bloodweaver is a Hearthstone card that is no longer playable in the Standard format of the game. During it's peak, players used it's card effect to create 'miracles'; aka huge swing turns that can lead to a two-turn win. Decks built around it were popular and also dominated in championships. Overall this was a technically challenging playstyle that required quick thinking with great payoffs! </p>
